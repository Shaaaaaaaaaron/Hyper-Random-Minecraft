If you have any other idea to add for the randomizer list, you can suggest it! (Discarded ideas: Block Drops Randomizer, Mob Drops Randomizer, and Recipe Randomizer)
## About
This datapack is a combination of 8 different random packs I made, and it's customizable. It gives a challenging and different way to play the game.
Info about the different randomizers below!

## List of randomizers

**- Chest Loot Randomizer**
  - Randomizes the loot found in structures
 
**- Entity Color Randomizer**
  - Randomizes the name and glowing aura color of every mob and player
  - When a mob takes damage, they get glowing for one second
  - Includes a death count scoreboard and a health list on TAB

**- Mob Equipment Randomizer**
  - Randomizes the items of every hostile and neutral mob
  - Even mobs that don't look like they're wearing armor or items, they _actually_ are
  - Every mob has a chance of dropping their items

**- Mob NBT Randomizer**
  - Randomizes some mob NBT tags like Movement Speed, Attack Damage, and Health
  - Gives every animal and Zombie a chance of being a baby variant
  - Gives every Creeper a chance of being charged
  - The Ender Dragon is not affected by these tags

  - Every 5 seconds each player gets 1 to 4 arrows
  - Every item can get random enchantments
  - You can ONLY attack by using the items given by the randomizer
 
**- Potion Effect Randomizer**
  - Every 5 seconds each mob and player will get a random potion effect
  - Each effect will last for 15 seconds (except for Levitation), for a total of 3 effects at once
  - Potion effects you can't get: Instant Damage, Wither

**- Time and Weather Randomizer**
  - Every 30 seconds the will advance or change, or either change the weather between rain, thunder, and normal

## Customization
The datapack includes the option to disable and enable the randomizers you want.
Simply use **/trigger hrm.settings!** (Sadly, due to how Minecraft works, the Chest Loot Randomizer can't be disabled this way. If you really want to disable it, open the datapack .zip file, then go to "data/minecraft/loot_tables/chests" and delete the folder named "chests")

Hope you enjoy playing with this! (it's quite challenging though lol)
